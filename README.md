# How to Use the ERD Interface

The ERD Interface is very simple and follows the notation taught in the **CS542** class at **WPI**. You can create **Attributes**, **Entities**, and **Relations** using the buttons, and connect them by **dragging edges (handles)** between the nodes.

You can delete a connection or a node by selecting it and simply pressing **Backspace**.

### What Happens When You Hit "Generate"?

When you click the **Generate** button, after performing basic validation, it returns the class objects of **Entities** and **Relations** as two separate objects.

The **Entity** objects contain:
- `name`
- `primary_key`
- All associated **attributes** (with types: PK, CK, Normal)
- All connected **relations** (e.g., Many-to-Many, One-to-Many, etc.)

### How to Load Saved ERDs

To load a saved ERD, pass the `id`, `savedNodes`, and `savedEdges` as props to the `ERD` component:

```jsx
<ERD id={"id"} savedNodes={[]} savedEdges={[]} />
```

To start fresh with a new diagram:

```jsx
<ERD />
```

Depending on whether you pass an ID or not, the component will automatically **create** or **update** the diagram.

### Raw Nodes and Edges Format for Saving

If you load the homepage right now, it displays a mock diagram. The data for that diagram is in the `mock.js` file.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** When saving or loading, your `nodes` and `edges` must follow this format ‚Äî not the custom class structure we created for logic.

# ERD-to-SQL Converter Backend
This is a simple, one-page app that integrates a React frontend with a Python backend using Flask for middleware, Oracle SQL for ERD functionality, and SQLLite for authentication.
For the purposes of this application, only the contents of `dbms-python` are relevant - the `dbms` folder should be regarded only as a reference point for our legacy backend structure.

Follow the steps below to run your own instance of the app locally.

1. Clone/fork/download the repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Navigate to `dbms-python` in your CLI and run `chmod +x run.sh`
3. Enter `./run.sh` into your command line and navigate to the indicated URL to run the application.

## Summary of Existing Endpoints
### Authentication Not Required
#### @app.route('/')
Landing page - defaults to login if unauthenticated, dashboard if a valid session is detected.
#### @app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
Request data from login form routed through this endpoint. Flask-login used to screen credentials against locally stored SQLLite database.
#### @app.route('/create-user')
Skeleton endpoint for user registration. With some modification, and association to an appropriate form, can be tailored to take in necessary data.

### Authentication Required
#### @app.route('/logout')
Forcibly expires the current session, returning end user to unauthenticated view.
#### @app.route('/dashboard')
Serves auth-gated functionality. Only accessible when logged in with valid credentials. Data retrieval and saving is possible through here.
#### @app.route('/api/data')
Fetches data. Skeleton implementation done, and Python code for this can be duplicated with query modified to fetch anything pre-existing from Oracle SQL.
#### @app.route('/api/create-diagram', methods=['POST'])
Posts data to existing database. Skeleton implementation done, and Python code for this can be duplicated with query modified to insert anything into pre-existing tables from Oracle SQL.
